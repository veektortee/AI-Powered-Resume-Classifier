# Resume Classification with Fine-Tuned BERT

This project showcases a **resume classification system** fine-tuned on preprocessed data provided by (https://github.com/noran-mohamed/Resume-Classification-Dataset). It classifies resumes into predefined categories using a **Streamlit app** for user interaction.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Dataset**: Preprocessed data adapted from a GitHub user‚Äôs repository.  
- **Model**: Fine-tuned `BERT` for multiclass text classification.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Cleaned text from provided data.  
  - Augmentation with GPT-2, synonym replacement, and random deletion.  
  - Applied sliding window tokenization for long text inputs.  
- **Training**:  
  - Initial phase: train classification head only.  
  - Fine-tuning phase: unfreeze BERT layers for deeper learning.  
  - Achieved ~96% train accuracy and ~90% validation accuracy.  
- **Classification**:  
  - Supports **43 predefined resume categories**.  
  - Resumes outside these categories will not be accurately classified.  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit app for uploading and classifying resumes.  
- **Optimizations**:  
  - Reduced learning rate during training.  
  - Early stopping and dropout regularization.
